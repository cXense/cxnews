     This method is a simple example of working with Cxense Content APIs.
     
     First thing that you should know about Cxense Content is that it operates
     with widgets. Widgets are html templates that can be configured on 'https://content.cxense.com'
     and which will be rendered later on the web page that imports that widget. 
     
     On mobile platforms each widget carries set of content items that can be presented
     by your application's UI. 
     
     Widgets show user specific content, that is why they should be configured properly.
